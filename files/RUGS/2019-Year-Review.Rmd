## Teaching 

Background: 

- Most mobules hoping to offer R versions of computer practicals 
- No School-wide coordination on what packages used 
- Many module organisers & practical leaders new to R
- New MSc in Data Science likely (surely?) involves R training 

Next steps?

- Organise a meeting of module organisers and R users 
- Discuss 'roadmap' for R at the School: look ahead 
- Agree process for developing curriculum so R-learning in different modules mutually supportive
