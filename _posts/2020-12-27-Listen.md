Listen 

I’m sorry to be the one to tell you that it’s 

over

I know part of you sees sweetness, still 

You say they’ve changed 

it’s not your fault

But I think you know it 

takes two

And it’s not working 



It hurts because you tried 

Beating yourself up about 

cooking this, wearing 

that

Having kids, or not

Getting a dog, or not

None of that matters

I mean, it matters but it 

doesn’t 



Remember when even  

you said: I give it 

12 months

What happened to the last two?

Your mum was ill 

and it brought you 

together 

That was beautiful and 

brief 



You can’t act differently

You have to change who 

you are 

Which you’ve been talking about 

For a long time now, sure 

But it stings to accept 

You’re not who they need 



Everyone wonders: will we get back together 

And the answer is: 

no 

Two different people could start something new

Forward together, not back

But I’m afraid: it’s over 

Stop beating yourself up

You’re not helping
