Listen 
I’m sorry to be the one to tell you that it’s 
over
I know part of you sees sweetness, still 
You say they’ve changed 
it’s not your fault
But I think you know it 
takes two
And it’s not working 

It hurts because you tried 
Beating yourself up about 
cooking this, wearing 
that
Having kids, or not
Getting a dog, or not
None of that matters
I mean, it matters but it 
doesn’t 

Remember when even  
you said: I give it 
12 months
What happened to the last two?
Your mum was ill 
and it brought you 
together 
That was beautiful and 
brief 

You can’t act differently
You have to change who 
you are 
Which you’ve been talking about 
For a long time now, sure 
But it stings to accept 
You’re not who they need 

Everyone wonders: will we get back together 
And the answer is: 
no 
Two different people could start something new
Forward together, not back
But I’m afraid: it’s over 
Stop beating yourself up
You’re not helping
