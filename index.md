Thanks for visiting my site. I work as an evaluation specialist at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) on projects relating to disability, HIV, sex work (e.g. my PhD [here](https://github.com/calumdavey/PhD/blob/master/Thesis/Submitted%20thesis/After%20fixing%20errors/2020_PHP_PhD_Davey_C.pdf)), stepped-wedge trials, education, and evaluation methods. I'm one of the deputy directors of the [Centre for Evaluation](http://evaluation.lshtm.ac.uk/). 

I've worked with the [Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/), and with the [Centre of Excellence for Development Impact and Learning (CEDIL)](https://cedilprogramme.org/). My current position is with the [PENDA](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/penda) project, learning about interventions to improve inclusion of people with disabilities in development projects. I also lead the POInT (Process-Outcome Integration with Theory) project that is applying the formal causal modelling techniques to the analysis of theories of change. 

I'm interested in the evaluation of interventions for public health and development. I try to focus on interventions that address up-stream social determinants of health and wellbeing. I'm still trying to develop a systems perspective, both for the interventions being evaluated but also the way we view wellbeing and how policy decisions are made. 

I teach on an MSc course on Evaluation methods that I co-founded with my supervisor, James Hargreaves. For more information see my [LSHTM profile](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/davey.calum), [Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=pm4eXUEAAAAJ&hl=en), or view my [CV](files/cv.pdf) (pdf).

Please feel free to contact me at [calum.davey@lshtm.ac.uk](calum.davey@lshtm.ac.uk). I sporadically waste an afternoon pointlessly arguing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CalumDavey?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and otherwise re-tweeting links and comments from people more informed or hilarious than me.
