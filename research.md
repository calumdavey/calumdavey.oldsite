## Research 
I'm interested in the evaluation of interventions for public health and development. I try to focus on interventions that address up-stream social determinants of health and wellbeing. I'm still trying to develop a systems perspective, both for the interventions being evaluated but also the way we view wellbeing and how policy decisions are made.
