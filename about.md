title: About
---

I have been working as an epidemiologist at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) since  2011, on projects relating to HIV, sex work, stepped-wedge trials, education, and mental health. I'm a member of the [Centre for Evaluation](http://evaluation.lshtm.ac.uk/). Recently, I've worked with the [Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/), and with the [Centre of Excellence for Development Impact and Learning (CEDIL)](https://cedilprogramme.org/)

I'm interested in the evaluation of interventions for public health and development. I try to focus on interventions that address up-stream social determinants of health and wellbeing. I'm still trying to develop a systems perspective, both for the interventions being evaluated but also the way we view wellbeing and how policy decisions are made. 

I teach on an MSc course on Evaluation methods that I co-founded with my supervisor, James Hargreaves.
